# Loot Menu Updated
    Fixed looting of NPCs in Anchorage and Point Lookout.
    Fixed loot menu width calculation to correctly match the widest element.
    Fixed an issue where, at high FPS, weapons could be reloaded or unholstered when opening containers with animations.
    Fixed an issue where rapidly switching the crosshair from a container to an actor could cause the loot menu to remain visible.
    Fixed the loot menu appearing while in VATS.
    Added automatic hiding of the loot menu when grabbing objects.
